* Use a different AI prompt with self spells and buffs, such as Mirror Image, and Bless
* Do version checking on the server to run the appropriate response when an outdated client makes a request (perhaps just respond to update their module)
* Add a way for the DM to set pronouns for Characters. (Default they/them).
* What happens with spells such as Light?
* Can reactions be factored in?
* Use a loading icon on a chat card
* Option to enable/disable module
* Option to whisper to GM, or go public with responses.
